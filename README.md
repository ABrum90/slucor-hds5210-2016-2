## Course Overview
Students will be introduced to concepts in computer programming using the Python programming language. Students will learn to conceptualize steps required to perform a task, manipulate files, create loops, and functions. By the end of this course, students will have a basic understanding of computer programming, a working knowledge of the Python programming language, and they will be able to share their scripts to collaborate with other team members.

Upon completion of the course, students will:
1. Understand fundamental concepts in computer science.
2. Compose programs for data acquisition and processing with Python.
3. Collaborate and share scripts with other students.
4. Describe methods and communicate program purpose and usage to general audiences.

## Course Description
This is primarily a classroom-based lecture and workshop, with additional at-home and online readings, exercises, and exams. The course is designed to be a collaborative learning experience, and therefore requires active participation by all students.
