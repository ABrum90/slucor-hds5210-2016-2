_HDS5w10: Programming for Health Data Scientists_

Getting Started with GitHub
===

You'll be able to find all of our course materials on GitHub.com in the following project. As we progress through the semester, more and more content will be added, including reading assignments, exercises, exams, and other supplemental materials. We've chosen to teach the basics of software source code control because of the value this discipline brings to creating managed and understandable programs, and to use GitHub.com because of its openness and popularity among programmers. **GitHub.com will be a key part of how you will access information for this course and submit your work.**

1 - Signing Up
---
Anyone with an email address can sign up for a GitHub.com account entirely for free, and students will get special features by signing up with their slu.edu email address using the form at this page: https://education.github.com/pack/join

2 - Software You Need
---
You can use Git, the source control software behind GitHub.com, on any computer where you can install software. None of our class work will require you to use your own computer to access GitHub.com or the Python programming language that we'll be using. All of our course work can be done just using a web browser. If you are interested in using Git on your personal computer, though, these resources can help you get started:
* https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/ - The basic Git desktop client software is available here.
* https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree - SourceTree is a desktop client for Git and is easily configurable for GitHub.com.
